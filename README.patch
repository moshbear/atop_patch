ATOP can be used without kernel-patches. In that case no
information is available about the disk- and network-traffic on a
per-process basis. This means a.o. that the selection 'd' (show
disk-transfers per process) and 'n' (show network-transfers per
process) can not be used, and the columns shown in the generic
screen are different.

Two kernel-patches are delivered for ATOP:

  01patch-3.2.2_atopcnt
	This patch takes care that statistical counters are added
	to the process-administration (task_struct) and that these
	counters are incremented per process.
	The additional counters are shown via the process'
	/proc/PID/stat file as a second line of counters.
	The meaning of these counters:
	  - disk read transfers
	  - disk accumulated number of sectors read
	  - disk write transfers
	  - disk accumulated number of sectors written
	  - tcp  send requests
	  - tcp  accumulated number of bytes transmitted
	  - tcp  receive requests
	  - tcp  accumulated number of bytes received
	  - udp  send requests
	  - udp  accumulated number of bytes transmitted
	  - udp  receive requests
	  - udp  accumulated number of bytes received
	  - raw  send requests (e.g. echo requests by ping)
	  - raw  receive requests

	When this patch is installed, ATOP automatically shows
	another layout for the generic screen (including disk-
	and network-transfers for active processes). However for
	terminated process these additional counters are not shown,
	because the conventional layout of the process-accounting
	record has not been adapted.

  02patch-3.2.2_atopacct
	This patch takes care that the additional statistical
	counters are added to the process-accounting record (yes,
	this means an incompatible layout of this record).

	Notice that this patch is an extension of the 01XXX_atopcnt
	patch! This patch can not be installed on its own.

	When this patch is installed, ATOP automatically shows
	the additional counters for terminated processes as well.
	Since the pid of processes is also stored in the modified
	process-accounting record, matching this info with the
	formerly running process is less time-consuming compared to
	the conventional process-accounting record.


The following steps are needed to install these patches:

     1.	Install the kernel-sources (e.g. as a subdirectory of /usr/src).

     2. Go to the new subdirectory, e.g. linux-3.2.2
  
     3.	Start the command to patch the new tree.

	Example for kernel-version 3.2.2:

		patch -p1 < 01patch-3.2.2_atopcnt

		patch -p1 < 02patch-3.2.2_atopacct

	This will modify the kernel-sources under /usr/src/linux-3.2.2

     4.	Build a new kernel and reboot.

	When the patch ..._atopacct has been installed, take care that
	the current process-accounting file (filled with the old
 	record-layout till now) is removed. This is only relevant when
 	your system permanently logs process-accounting records triggered
	by the file /etc/logrotate.d/psacct. Thus if this file is present,
	issue the following commands after you rebooted your system:

	  /usr/sbin/accton                      # switch off accounting
       	  > /var/account/pacct			# empty accounting file
       	  /usr/sbin/accton /var/account/pacct	# switch on  accounting
